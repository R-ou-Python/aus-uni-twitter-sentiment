# aus-uni-twitter-sentiment
Builds a Twitter scraper and subsequent analytical algorithms for Australian universities to analyse sentiment regarding COVID-19.

## Motivation

Australia's universities are some of the most impact organisations when it comes to public health and social crises. Understanding their responses in consideration of the differential impacts across the university types (mission group, size, research intensity, international student volume) may yield interesting outputs for the education sector.

## Languages

This project uses a combination of R and Python.

## Intended output

Machine learning algorithm-based outputs such as cluster analysis, as well as more traditional text and sentiment analytic outputs. Data visualisations are the intended information dissemination medium. A machine learning classification model is also slated to be developed to enable easy classification of future tweets.

## Disclaimer

This analysis does not intent to defame or portrary any institution negatively. Rather, it aims to produce a quantitative textual analysis of topical tweet content.
